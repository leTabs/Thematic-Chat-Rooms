# Thematic-Chat-Rooms

The thematic chatrooms project is a web application that offers users chatrooms to join, based on
different themes, such as music and art. Inside the chatrooms, the users can interact with other users in
real-time conversations.

It was created mainly by Python and takes advantage of sockets.
